{"name":"Nucleotide-control-rgb-leds","tagline":"An Arduino sketch to blink RGB LEDs after a nucleotide sequence","body":"---\r\nNucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs\r\n---\r\n![](Picture-of-setup.jpg)\r\nAn Arduino sketch that blinks RGB LED strips according to a DNA\r\nsequence. Its purpose is to provide an extra dimension to Christmas, and other\r\ndecorative, LED ligthing. Therefore, the sktech is preloaded with a\r\ngene sequence from Norway Spruce, *Picea abies*, so that you can put up\r\na truly *meta* Christmas tree. Or, you can make a Christmas tree shape\r\nfrom LEDs and have yourself a minimalist *abstract* Christmas.\r\n\r\n![](Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs_bb.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe code was developed for LED strips with separate R, G, B LEDs,\r\nbut it should work just fine with combined RGB LED strips (or single\r\nLEDs), as long as you do the wiring properly. If you run a true RGB LED strip,\r\nwhere all the LEDs are combined under one lens, it is possible to get better\r\ntransitions and more colors with very little code tweaking. The\r\ninformation on how the code works is contained in the code comments, so be sure to check those out in the [Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs.ino](https://github.com/Oftatkofta/Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs/blob/master/Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs.ino) file.\r\n\r\nSchematic wiring diagrams for the driving circuit are available in the\r\nrepository in both .fzz and .PDF formats, with file names\r\n'Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs.fzz', and\r\n'Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs.PDF', respectively.\r\n\r\n![](Nucleotide-Control-RGB-LEDs_schem.jpg)\r\n\r\n##List Components\r\n* 1 x Arduino Pro Nano clone (16 MHz Atmega328P)\r\n* 3 x 5 m common cathode RGB LED strips\r\n* 3 x 8.2 kOhm resistors\r\n* 3 x TIP120 darlington transistors\r\n* 1 x LM2040CT-5.0 5V Voltage regulator (a 7805 will work fine too)\r\n* 1 x 1 uF 50 V capacitor\r\n* 1 x 22 uF 50 V capacitor\r\n* 1 x Nintendo GameCube 12 V power brick\r\n* some differently colored wires (helps with keeping track on which\r\nchannel is which)\r\n\r\n\r\n##To Do's before next holiday season\r\n\r\n* Real-time access to send GenBank accession numbers, so\r\neveryone can see their favourite gene, or genome, in action.\r\n\r\n* Probably Raspberry Pi integration.\r\n\r\n* Analogue knobs to change the variables controlling LED behaviour, such as\r\ngradient, speed, max_intensity *et.c.*\r\n\r\n* A fouth \"dimension\" of some sort to signal if the current nucleotide\r\nis exon or intron (coding, or non coding).\r\n\r\n* If I get a proper RGB strip I'll move on to amino acid (protein) sequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
